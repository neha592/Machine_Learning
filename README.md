    10. [wine quality prediction](https://github.com/neha592/Machine_Learning/blob/master/wine%20quality%20prediction.ipynb) : The aim is to predict the wine quality using regression modelling. Need to perform data analysis and post out the             finding from the analysis.

 * <b><u>Tools Used </u>:</b> <i> Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Scipy Tableau public Version .</i>  
 
I have created another repository containing project for data analysis it can be viewed here [Data_Analysis](https://github.com/neha592/EDA)

I have performed Data Analysis on few datasets using Tableau Public Version whose link is here: [Tableau Profile](https://public.tableau.com/profile/neha.singh3254#!/).

Note :  The datsets used in the above files is from various datset providing sites i don't owe any of them.
