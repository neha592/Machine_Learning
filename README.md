    11. [KNN](https://github.com/neha592/Machine_Learning/blob/master/KNN.ipynb) : To perform KNN algorithm on data set to build the model using Hyperparameter tuning (Grid SearchCV) for dataset containing         information about tumor of Breast Cancer. need to classify Malignant and Benign types .
    
    12. [Project](https://github.com/neha592/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Project.ipynb) : The aim is to predict the wine quality using regression modelling. Need to perform data analysis and post out the             finding from the analysis.

 * <b><u>Tools Used </u>:</b> <i> Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Scipy Tableau public Version .</i>  
 
I have created another repository containing project for data analysis it can be viewed here [Data_Analysis](https://github.com/neha592/EDA)

I have performed Data Analysis on few datasets using Tableau Public Version whose link is here: [Tableau Profile](https://public.tableau.com/profile/neha.singh3254#!/).

Note :  The datsets used in the above files is from various datset providing sites i don't owe any of them.
